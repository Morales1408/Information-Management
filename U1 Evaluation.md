## Instructions
--------------------------------------------
In pairs, do te following:

Determine and report how any of the compression algorithms seen on class (or similar) can be used in Data Science.
Elaborate a demo, including the compression process. You can reuse any code developed on the previous assignments.
The submission should include both a report and the code of the demo.

For the report, it is important to be specific what kind of compression is being used and how does it improves the process. Also, it should be structured as follows:

Introduction
Methodology
Results
Conclusions
References.
*The results are based on the tech demo.

 
Note: Even if the way to apply the compression to a data science process is the same among different teams, the reports and implementations (tech demos) should not. That is, there shouldn't be identical codes.
